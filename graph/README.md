The cities are represented as a graph

## Whiteboard Process
![buisness](graph/buisness.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Space: O (N), a variable was created inside a loop
Time: O(N*h) where N is the length of the list and H is the max number of neighbors of a vertex

## Solution
The function takes a graph and a list as arguments and returns the cost as integer
